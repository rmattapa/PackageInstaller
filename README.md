# Package Installer Exercise
Creating a Package Installer based on the dependency criteria.

## Description
Given an array of strings defining packages and their dependencies.Each string contains the name of a package followed by a colon and space then any dependencies required by that package. We are required to figure out the dependency order in order to know which dependencies needed to be installed first. This problem is an application of topological sort which is the key idea for my exercise.

## Instructions to be performed

```
Run commands in the following order:
npm install
npm start
```
All the test cases are involved in the tests/packageTestInstaller.js including the test cases which are mentioned in the document and some additional test cases. So change the test cases in test file in order to perform more testing and results are served in localhost page.
